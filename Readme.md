Hello! This is a full-stack MERN website. We've incorporated React for the frontend, MongoDB for the database, Express for the server, and Firebase for user authentication. In this website, customers have access to a variety of organic farm-produced products. Users can create accounts using Firebase authentication, and their data is securely stored in MongoDB. Once logged in, customers can browse through the available products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout. During checkout, they can review their cart contents and proceed with payment. Once the shopping is complete, customers can finalize their purchase, and the ordered products will be delivered within our specified timeframe.
